# Clinker Boat Tool (HDA)

Tool for reverse engineering and procedurally reconstructing historic clinker built boats to create clean, parametric 3D models based on overlaid photogrammetry scans. Initially developed as a research tool at the Game School at the University of Inland Norway in collaboration with Anno Museumâ€™s conservation initiative for early 20th-century clinker-built boats in Norway.
