# Clinker Boat Tool

A Houdini Digital Asset (HDA) for reverse-engineering and procedurally reconstructing historic clinker-built boats, generating clean, parametric 3D models from overlaid photogrammetry scans. Originally developed as a research project at the Game School, University of Inland Norway, in collaboration with Anno Museumâ€™s conservation program for early 20th-century Norwegian clinker-built boats.
